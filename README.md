# Statistics-project-2023

The purpose of this study and the parameter of interest is to examine how the number of international students in the United States has changed between 1963 and 2022. The United States is a popular destination for international students because American institutions offer excellent academic and professional opportunities. In addition to benefiting students, colleges, and universities also benefit from international students because they help create diverse and cross-cultural experiences in classrooms. As someone who has been an international student since a young age, I have seen an increase in the number of international students and the diversity of their nationalities. Many of my closest friends are international students, and even at my current university, most of the people I interact with are international students. Every semester I notice an increase in international students, which is why I chose this research topic in order to see if the statistical data supports my opinion.
